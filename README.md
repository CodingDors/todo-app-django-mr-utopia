# ToDo App Exercise - Django
Welcome to the ToDo App Exercise with Django! In this assignment, you'll create a basic ToDo application using Django.

This exercise is designed to be straightforward, where you'll need to work on the `tasks/views.py`. Your goal is to make the page built in `tasks/templates/tasks/index.html` to bring the ToDo application to life.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
Your task is to create a simple ToDo application that allows a user to:
- Enter a task using a form.
- View the entered task appended to an unordered list on the page.

You'll only write in the `tasks/views.py` file. In case you need to see the solution, it is at `tasks/answer.py`.

## âœ… Specific Tasks:
You will be responsible for the following:
### Update views.py:
  - Create a view to display tasks and handle the submission of new tasks.
  - Ensure that new tasks are added to the list and displayed in the index.html template.

## Sample Solutions:
  If you're stuck or would like to compare your implementation with our version, check the `tasks/answer.py` for the view logic.

## ðŸ“˜ How to Run Your Website:
1. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Start the Django development server: `python manage.py runserver`
3. Access the application via your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ or the URL provided by your development environment.

## ðŸš€ How to Run Tests:
To make sure your application is working as expected:

1. Stop the server if it's still running (you can use Ctrl+C in the terminal for that).
2. In your terminal, run the following command: `python manage.py test`

## ðŸ¤” How to Submit:
Once all the tests have completed:
1. Stage Changes:
  - View your changes in the Source Control view.
  - Click on the + (plus) sign next to the files you wish to stage.
2. Commit Changes:
  - Enter a descriptive commit message.
  - Press Ctrl + Enter (or Cmd + Enter on macOS) to commit the changes.
3. Push Changes:
  - Click on the ellipsis ... in the Source Control view.
  - Select Push.
4.Verify you code has passed
